Lazy loading your WordPress images can speed up your website and offer a better user experience.

Images take the most time to load on your website compared to other web elements. If you add a lot of images to your articles, then each image increases your page load 
time.One way to handle this situation is to use a CDN service, like BunnyCDN. A CDN will let a user download images from a web server closest to them and reduce website 
loading speeds.However, your images will still be loaded and affect the overall page load time. To overcome this issue, you can delay image loading by implementing lazy 
load on your website.
