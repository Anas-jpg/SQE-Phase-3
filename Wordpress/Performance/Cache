WordPress caching is the fastest way to improve performance.

When a page is rendered, php and mysql are used. Therefore, system needs RAM and CPU.
If many visitors come to a site, system uses lots of RAM and CPU so page is rendered so slowly. In this case, you need a cache system not to render page again and again. 
Cache system generates a static html file and saves. Other users reach to static html page.

In addition, the site speed is used in Google’s search ranking algorithm so cache plugins that can improve your page load time will also improve your SEO ranking.

Browser caching:

Browser caching can help to reduce server load by reducing the number of requests per page. For example, by setting the correct file headers on files that don’t change
(static files like images, CSS, JavaScript etc) browsers will then cache these files on your visitor’s computer. This technique allows the browser to check to see if 
files have changed, instead of simply requesting them. The result is your web server can answer many more 304 responses, confirming that a file is unchanged, instead of
200 responses, which require the file to be sent.
