Super Progressive Web Apps makes it easy for you to convert your WordPress website into a Progressive Web App instantly!

Once SuperPWA is installed, users browsing your website from a supported mobile device will see a “Add To Home Screen” notice (from the bottom of the screen) and will be
able to ‘install your website’ on the home screen of their device. Every page visited is stored locally on their device and will be available to read even when they are 
offline!

SuperPWA is easy to configure, it takes less than a minute to set-up your Progressive Web App! SuperPWA does a clean uninstall, by removing every database entry and file
that it creates. In fact, none of the default settings are saved to the database until you manually save it the first time. Go ahead and give it a try.
