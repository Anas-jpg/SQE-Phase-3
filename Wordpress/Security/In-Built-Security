1.1  WordPress has undergone continual hardening so its core software can address and mitigate common security threats, 
     including the Top 10 list identified by The Open Web Application SecurityProject (OWASP) as common security vulnerabilities,
     which are discussed in this document.

1.2  The WordPress Security Team, in collaboration with the WordPress Core Leadership Team and backed by the WordPress global community, 
    works to identify and resolve security issues in the core software available for distribution and installation at WordPress.org, as
    well as recommending and documenting security best practices for third-party plugin and theme authors
    
1.3  Site developers and administrators should pay particular attention to the correct use of core APIs and underlying server configuration 
     which have been the source of common vulnerabilities, as well as ensuring all users employ strong passwords to access WordPress
1.4  The WordPress Security Team often collaborates with other security teams to address issues in common dependencies, such as resolving the
     vulnerability in the PHP XML parser, used by the XML-RPC API that ships with WordPress, in WordPress 3.9.24. This vulnerability resolution
     was a result of a joint effort by both WordPress and Drupal security teams.
