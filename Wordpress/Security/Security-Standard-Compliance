1.1	 This guideline has been issued by the Chief Information Officer to supplement the Vulnerability Management standard.
     Compliance with this guideline is recommended, but not mandatory. Questions about this guideline may be referred to
     information.security@ubc.ca.

1.2  While it would be impossible to list all compliance regulations, the following are a few common ones to be aware of as a WordPress website owner
      •	General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)
      •	Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS)
      •	ISO 27001
      •	Health Insurance Portability & Accountability Act (HIPAA)
1.3  PCI for WordPress & e-commerce sites
        Since most WordPress sites use a third party payment gateway, the scope and requirements are lower. 
        In fact most probably compliance can be achieved by completing the PCI Data Security Standard Self 
        Assessment Questionnaire (SAQ). However you should still inform yourself  about the requirements,
        so whenever you make changes you can determine what is required to remain compliant
