Modular code that is easy to (re)use is an important skill if you are considering developing WordPress themes or plugins
A component is anything that is also displayed on a WordPress website. Think of a grid of articles, buttons, headings, images, toggle sections, tabs, 
a list of categories and so forth.

Creating a structure for Modular components: step by step Procedure

1. Set up your development environment
       For Development, set up a WordPress website running locally, and VSCode as editor
2. Create a new folder structure in /wp-content/plugins
3. •	 Booting the plugin: /wp-php-components-example.php
4. The component class: /src/classes/Components/Component.php
       Our component class is interesting. This is an abstract class, meaning 
       it can not be executed by itself. The abstract class sets the rules for
       how all child classes (classes that extend this class) should look like.
5. An example component: /src/classes/Components/Example.php
      The example component class extends the abstract class, which as I explained
      functions as a class ‘template’. As a property, I have added the text key in
      ‘props’ which allows adding some text. And that’s it! The rest is already defined
      by our abstract component class
