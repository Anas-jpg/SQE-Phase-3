WordPress files and directories are stored on your web hosting server. You can access these files by using an FTP client.
Inside the root folder, you’ll see the core WordPress files and folders. These are the files and folders that run your WordPress site.
Apart from .htaccess and wp-config.php files, you are not supposed to edit other files on your own.

Here is a list of core WordPress files and folders that you would see in your WordPress site’s root directory.
•	wp-admin [dir]
•	wp-content [dir]
•	wp-includes [dir]
•	index.php
•	license.txt
•	readme.html
•	wp-activate.php
•	wp-blog-header.php
•	wp-comments-post.php
•	wp-config-sample.php
•	wp-cron.php
•	wp-links-opml.php
•	wp-load.php
•	wp-login.php
•	wp-mail.php
•	wp-settings.php
•	wp-signup.php
•	wp-trackback.php
•	xmlrpc.php

The above list is missing .htaccess and wp-config.php files. That’s because those two files are created after WordPress installation
WordPress Configuration Files

Your WordPress root directory contains some special configuration files. These files contain important settings specific to your WordPress site
•	.htaccess – A server configuration file, WordPress uses it to manage permalinks and redirects.
•	wp-config.php – This file tells WordPress how to connect to your database. It also sets some global settings for your WordPress site.
•	index.php – The index file basically loads and initializes all your WordPress files when a page is requested by a user.
You may need to edit wp-config.php or .htaccess file sometimes. Be extra careful when editing these two files.
A slight mistake can make your site inaccessible. When editing these two files, always create backup copies on your computer before making any changes.

Depending on how your WordPress site is setup, you may or may not have the following files in your root directory.
•	robots.txt – contains instructions for search engines crawlers
•	Favicon.ico – A favicon file is sometimes generated by WordPress hosts

Contents of the wp-content folder may differ from one WordPress site to another. But all WordPress sites usually have these:
•	[dir] themes
•	[dir] plugins
•	[dir] uploads
•	index.php

Some other default folders you may see in your wp-content directory.
•	languages – WordPress stores language files for non-english WordPress sites in this folder.
•	upgrade – This is a temporary folder created by WordPress during upgrade to a newer version.
