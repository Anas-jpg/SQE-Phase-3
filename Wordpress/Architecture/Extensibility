Have you ever used a plugin and wished it did something a bit differently? Perhaps you needed something unique that was beyond the scope of the settings page 
of the plugin. If you're a WordPress plugin developer, most likely some of your users have  also encountered this while using your plugin.
Here's a typical scenario: You've finally found that plugin that does everything you need — except for one tiny
important thing. There is no setting or option to enable that tiny thing, so you browse the documentation and find that you can't do anything about it.
You request the feature in the WordPress plugin's support forum — but no dice. In the end, you uninstall it and continue your search.

common scenerio of Plugin:

function get_some_post_titles() {
  $args = array(
      'posts_per_page' => 3,
  );

  $posts = get_posts( $args );

  $output = '';
  foreach ( $posts as $post ) {
      $output .= '' . $post->post_title . '';
  }
  $output .= '';

  return $output;
}



We'd make the plugin extensible

By studying the plugin's code above, we see a few operations that the main function performs:
•	It gets posts using get_posts.
•	It generates a list of post titles.
•	It returns the generated list.

Rules of Thumb
•	add myplugin_get_posts_args for modifying the arguments of get_posts,
•	add myplugin_get_posts for overriding the results of get_posts,
•	add myplugin_list_item for customizing the generation of a list entry,
•	add myplugin_get_some_post_titles for overriding the returned generated list.

Example of Extensible plugin WITH Extensibility:

function get_some_post_titles() {
  $args = array(
      'posts_per_page' => 3,
  );

  // Let other people modify the arguments.
  $posts = get_posts( apply_filters( 'myplugin_get_posts_args', $args ) );

  // Let other people modify the post array, which will be used for display.
  $posts = apply_filters( 'myplugin_get_posts', $posts, $args );

  $output = '';
  foreach ( $posts as $post ) {

      // Let other people modify the list entry.
      $output .= '' . apply_filters( 'myplugin_list_item', $post->post_title, $post ) . '';
  }
  $output .= '';

  // Let other people modify our output list.
  return apply_filters( 'myplugin_get_some_post_titles', $output, $args );
}
