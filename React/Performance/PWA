PWA is used by React JS to provide a better user experience because it has the following advantages:

1.Speed: PWA-powered websites load pages more quickly than regular websites.
Since all web pages are cached, it takes less time for consumers to load the website when they return.


2. Widely compatible: PWA is compatible with practically all browsers and operating systems.


3. Offline working mode: Users can view website content with or without an internet connection because data is pre-cached.


4.SEO-friendly: PWA can assist websites in obtaining a high Google Core Web Vitals score, increasing traffic and client retention.
