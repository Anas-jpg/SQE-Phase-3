ESLint is the linter used by React.


Lining up your code is a good habit because it enables you to find any potential issues.

Linters help because React is an open source project and is prone to problems, especially when integrating.


You can fully configure it to tell you things like: -if you imported something but never used it -if your function might be short-handed.
