For its front end, React uses a microservices architecture.


There were various "projects" within the application.

-

A microservice is often an autonomous, deployable entity in backend development.

-

Microservices (npm packages) for each entity in a web or mobile application can also be created.
This microservice will include all of the logic related to this entity.

1. They have a state of their own.

2. Only communicate with other components via interfaces, such as by creating an index.js file to only expose specific components to the outside world.

3. Establish clear and binding contracts.
You must define a component or function, the properties, and the object that will be returned.
