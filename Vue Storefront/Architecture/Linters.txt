Lint, or a linter, is a static code analysis tool used to flag programming errors, bugs, stylistic errors and suspicious constructs

Vue Store Front is composed of 
Vue.js
Nuxt.js
Server Middleware



So for Vue.Js,  The official eslint-plugin-vue supports linting both the template and script parts of Vue single file components.

Make sure to use the plugin's included config in your ESLint config:

Another option is using eslint-loader so that your *.vue files are automatically linted on save during development:

npm install -D eslint eslint-loader

for Nuxt.js, If you want to have runtime lint (having ESLint running after a file has been saved), you can enable the eslint
feature of fork-ts-checker-webpack-plugin by configuring the typeCheck module option
