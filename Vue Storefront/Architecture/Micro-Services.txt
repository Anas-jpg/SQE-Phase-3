Microservices architecture is a concept of building an application based on breaking it into multiple modules. 
Each module has its own specific responsibilities but communicates with others to form a unified system.
This approach provides freedom of development and choice of tools (technology language, framework) within each application

Each microservice can be accessed in one of two ways in this schematic application:

From an API gateway (via a mobile app)
From a Web application (via the userâ€™s web browser)


Vue Store front implemeneted the micro-Services as if we want to Access the Account Service
or Inventory Service we can easily Acccess through API gateway or Web Application
