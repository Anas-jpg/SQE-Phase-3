SSR Output Cache:
Vue Storefront supports a very efficient Server Side Rendering cache. In this mode, the generated HTML pages are fully stored in the Redis cache. The cache entries
are then tagged with all the products, categories (and potentially other data entities) used to render that specific page.
Let’s say the Category page contains 20 products products = [{id:120,…},{id:324,…},…] after this specific category page got rendered, Vue Storefront would tag the 
output cache entry with the following tags: P120, P324. 
Each time, Vue Storefront indexers (both: mage2vuestorefront and magento2-vsbridge-indexer) are pushing the changes for any of the tagged product to Elastic storage,
the indexer is calling an URL like: https://your-istace.com/ivalidate?tags=P120. This request invalidates cache, assigned to this specific product. There is no risk
the user will get any outdated product information.
Typical cached requests take about 2–50ms to execute — compared to about 100ms for non-cached ones.
When you’re dealing with a memory-leak, the SSR cache can be very helpful. Maybe not eliminate the leak but rather to … live with it. By just limiting the memory
usage as the number of dynamic requests processed by Vue.js got significantly lower with cache on.

How it works? 
When the page is requested, the cache driver checks if there is an already rendered page in the cache matching the current route. If the rendered page exists, 
the cache driver will serve the cached version. Otherwise, the current page will be rendered on the server and served to the user, but if it contains tags, 
the result will be saved in the cache and used for subsequent requests.

API Output Cache:
Although the SSR cache is pretty cool — even when it’s enabled, the cache hit ratio still would be pretty low. It’s because most of the requests are executed in 
CSR (client-side mode), querying the API directly from the client's browser. If you’re facing any Elastic performance issues or it’s high on resources that you’d 
like to limit— it’s a time to introduce the API output cache.
It is recommended to put an nginx or varnish proxy in front of vue-storefront-api. With such a proxy, adding the API cache is pretty easy.

Dynamic API output caching:
From the Vue Storefront 1.11 (currently, experimental release) there will be an option to use Dynamic output catching. With this model on the output cache from 
the API will be tagged with dynamic tags corresponding to all the products and categories which are included in the search results.
If the product with ID = 123 exists on the results page API will tag the output with a P123 tag. All of our official indexers magento*-vsbridge-indexer and 
mage2vuestorefront do support the dynamic cache invalidation. This means that the output cache will be invalidated page by page whatever any product stock 
or category information changed.
