Before the 1.11 release, we were using LocalStorage or IndexedDB to cache the products and categories for the offline mode purposes. It was because, not all the browsers
(iOS) were supporting Service Workers. However, it got changed! From 1.11 we’re using solely Service Workers.

The Service Workers cache works like we’re always executing the backend requests to invalidate the local cache. It’s the NetworkFirst mode. That means there is virtually
no risk of stale / non-invalidated data served from the local cache.
