1) Improved Security:
      Developing a PWA utilizing vue.js or transforming your vue.js into a PWA enforces transport layer security to encrypt all the sensitive information and data.

2) Lower Development Cost:
      Another amazing advantage of employing PWA and Vue JS is that you can reduce a lot of development costs. With PWA development, you can utilize the same stack for 
      both mobile and web. Also, it is helpful to reuse the same piece of code as much as possible. So, in the end, it allows businesses to lower the overall development
      cost for the web or mobile app.
      
3) Small Size:
      One shared feature between PWAs and Vue JS is that both are smaller in size. It is hardly in KBs. It assists businesses to leverage faster installation than any
      other frameworks or libraries. Such tiny size and quicker installation have captured many companies worldwide and left many widespread frameworks behind.
