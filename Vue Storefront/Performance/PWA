What is PWA?

Progressive Web Application (PWA) is a type of web app that can operate both as a web page and mobile app on any device. It is a great solution for poor mobile UX and 
low conversion rates in your online store. Using standard technologies, PWA is aimed at delivering native-like user experience, with speedier conversion and cleaner 
browsing even with a poor Internet connection. 

PWAs are written in JavaScript, CSS, and HTML. They look and behave just like regular web pages (which means they are searchable in internet browsers). However, they 
also deliver functionalities identical to those provided by mobile apps: they are fast, can work offline, send push notifications, and use the features of user devices.

For existing projects, you can run the vue add command to install the PWA plugin for Vue.

vue add pwa
