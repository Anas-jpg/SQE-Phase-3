Consider using WAF (Web Application Firewall)
It's usually a great idea to use an external line of control/filtering over your web application. 
Web Application Firewalls are just about it. You might find a whole variety of different on-prem and cloud solutions 
like AWS WAF, Fortinet, Nginx WAF and others. You can give it a try to open source ModSecurity as well.

Because vue-storefront and vue-storefront-api are both based on Express.js some features like request-throttling can be
 implemented by using just some Express middlewares.


All the write/user-sensitive operation are secured with token-based authorization in Vue Storefront.
 The catalog requests are open (via vue-storefront-api that can be used for limiting the data access, filtering etc).
 It might be worth considering the token-based, anti-csrf kind of authorization for catalog requests as well. It will 
let you easier control, throttle and limit the API request. That might be pretty usefull when not using the external WAF
 (Web Application Firewall) and still needing to implement some kind of anti-scrapping protection. I've desribed how it can work
