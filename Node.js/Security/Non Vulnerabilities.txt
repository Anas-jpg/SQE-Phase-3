Example:

Malicious Third-Party Modules (CWE-1357)
Code is trusted by Node.js, hence any situation requiring a malicious third-party module is not possible and cannot lead to a Node.js vulnerability.

Prototype Pollution Attacks (CWE-1321)
The inputs sent to Node.js by application code are trusted by it. Any situation requiring control over user input is not regarded as a vulnerability since it is up to the application to sanitise suitably.

Element of an uncontrolled search path (CWE-427)
The file system in the environment that is available to Node.js is trusted. Therefore, if it accesses/loads files from any path that is available to it, it is not a vulnerability.


External Control of System or Configuration Setting (CWE-15)
If a configuration file is loaded automatically by Node.js and is documented, then no scenario requiring modification of that configuration file is regarded as a vulnerability.
