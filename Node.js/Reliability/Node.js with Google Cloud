This document includes a step-by-step tutorial for deploying a NodeJS application to Google Cloud.


1) Open your Google Cloud account and log in.
Make an account if you're new to Google Cloud.
New customers also get $300 in free credits to run, test, and deploy workloads. 

2) Select or create a Google Cloud project in the Google Cloud console's project selector page.


3) Download, set up, and launch the Google Cloud CLI (Billing and Installation, etc).  

To set the default project for your Cloud Run service:
    " gcloud config set project PROJECT_ID "

Replace PROJECT_ID with the name of the project you created for this quickstart.
    
4) Write the sample application:-
    To write an application in Node.js:

    a) Create a new directory named helloworld and change directory into it:
            " mkdir helloworld "
            " cd helloworld "

    b) Make a package.json file and fill it with the following information: 

      `{
        "name": "helloworld",
        "description": "Simple hello world sample in Node",
        "version": "1.0.0",
        "private": true,
        "main": "index.js",
        "scripts": {
          "start": "node index.js"
        },
        "engines": {
          "node": ">=12.0.0"
        },
        "author": "Google LLC",
        "license": "Apache-2.0",
        "dependencies": {
          "express": "^4.17.1"
        }
      }


    c) Create a file called index.js in the same directory, and paste the lines below into it: 
      `run/helloworld/index.jsView on GitHub Feedback`
  
      `const express = require('express');
       const app = express();

      app.get('/', (req, res) => {
        const name = process.env.NAME || 'World';
        res.send(`Hello ${name}!`);
      });

      const port = parseInt(process.env.PORT) || 8080;
      app.listen(port, () => {
        console.log(`helloworld: listening on port ${port}`);
      });


A simple web server is created by this code, and it listens on the port specified by the PORT environment variable.


Your app is complete and prepared for distribution. 

5) Deploy to Cloud Run from source:

    a) To deploy from the source. In your source code directory, deploy from source using the following command:
        " gcloud run deploy "

    b) Visit your deployed service by opening the service URL in a web browser.
        
And Now the application is deployed on Google Cloud.
