Service Worker:

A JavaScript piece of code known as a service worker manages the cache for any assets and data you decide to keep for upcoming requests.


To make it work as a service worker, you must abide by the following rules: 


- It only works with valid HTTPS or http://localhost
- It only grabs requests within its scope
- It only has access to the files in its folder or “below”


Node.JS PWAs only work over HTTPS since the service worker can access and use the response. The service provider can receive and manage network requests, maintain 
the cache to enable offline functionality, and provide push notifications to your clients. Service employees offer much more precise control, which makes them 
flexible and suitable for a variety of use cases. Service workers do not obstruct the main JavaScript application code because they operate on a different thread.

Offline Experience:

For online applications, service workers can be leveraged to create offline experiences. Because they provide you with low-level granular control over intercepting 
and altering requests and caching resources, they stand out in this aspect.  



Background Synchronization:


Service workers also provide a background sync API since they want to improve offline experiences. This function enables the synchronization of web material without 
interfering with the user's experience. For instance, if a user submits a form while using a shaky connection, form data may be stored for background syncing. Once 
the connection has stabilised, the service worker can then sync the form data with the server in the background. 


Service Worker.js:


              `const CACHE = 'cat-image-cache'

              // Add content to the cache when the service worker is installed.
              self.addEventListener('install', (event) => {
                  event.waitUntil(caches.open(CACHE).then((cache) => {
                      cache.addAll(['./img']);
                  }));
              });

              // Intercept fetch requests.
              self.addEventListener('fetch', (event) => {
                  // First, satisfy the request with cached content.
                  event.respondWith(fetchFromCache(event.request));

                  // Then, update the cache.
                  event.waitUntil(updateCache(event.request));
              });

              // Fetches the requested content from the cache.
              function fetchFromCache(request) {
                  return caches.match(request).then((matching) => {
                      if (matching) {
                          return matching;
                      }

                      return fetch(request);
                  });
              }

              // Updates the cache from the server.
              function updateCache(request) {
                  return caches.open(CACHE).then((cache) => {
                      return fetch(request).then((response) => {
                          return cache.put(request, response.clone()).then(() => {
                              return response;
                          });
                      });
                  });
              }`
