Progressive Web Application:
A website that functions and seems like a mobile app is known as a progressive web app (PWA). 

PWA in node.js
Nodejs offers the implementation of PWA in the manner described below to give users the experience of a mobile application: 

1) We only require the following to establish the project's foundation: 

	-> Node.js to run the server 
	-> Express to run the HTTP server
	-> Create a self-signed certificate using OpenSSL
	-> Chrome to test the website and debug your PWA

2) Creating a basic HTTP Server

	: server.js
			`const express = require('express')
			const path = require('path')

			const httpPort = 80

			const app = express()

			app.use(express.static(path.join(__dirname, 'public')))

			app.get('/', function(req, res) {
			  res.sendFile(path.join(__dirname, 'public/index.html'))
			})

			app.listen(httpPort, function () {
			  console.log(`Listening on port ${httpPort}!`)
			})
			`
	: index.html
			`<html>
			  <body>
			    <span>This example is for the article of progressive web apps written for LogRocket</span>
			    <br>
			    <span>You are now</span> <span><b class="page-status">online</b></span>
			    <script src="/js/pwa.js"></script>
			  </body>
			</html>
			`
	: pwa.js
			`document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', init, false);
			function init() {
			  console.log('empty for now')
			}`
	We must use our localhost to access our site in order to see this initial configuration. 



3) Addition of a manifest file.

By including a Node.JS manifest, the condition for installability as well as the empty landing screen will both be met.The web app manifest is a simple file that 
provides information about your web app to the browser.It explains how it should function after being installed on the user's computer or mobile device. The Add to 
Home Button cannot timely show without the web app manifest. 

	: pwawebmanifest.js
		`{
		  "name": "Progressive Web App example",
		  "short_name": "pwa-tutorial",
		  "description": "Progressive Web App example to be used in conjuction with the article in LogRocket",
		  "icons": [
		    {
		      "src": "/../images/splash-screen.png",
		      "sizes": "512x512",
		      "type": "image/png"
		    }
		  ],
		  "start_url": "/",
		  "display": "fullscreen",
		  "theme_color": "#764ABC",
		  "background_color": "#764ABC"
		}`


4) Optimization:

Additional measures, such as those involving layout, content, and other factors, can be implemented to improve PWA.
