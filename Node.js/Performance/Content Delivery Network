Content Delievery Netork:
A dispersed group of proxy servers set up across many data centres and used for online delivery of content is known as a content delivery network (CDN). By 
utilising methods like web caching, load balancing, and request routing, a CDN aims to give end users excellent availability and performance.


Usage of CDN:
Expressjs, one of Node.js's frameworks, facilitates the use of CDNs in Node.js applications. Express-CDN is a Node.js module used to distribute assets that have 
been optimised, minified, mangled, gzipped, and hosted by a CDN (currently by Amazon S3 and Amazon CloudFront). 



Featurs of Express-CDN:


1) Automatic url(absoluteUrl) parsing of background, background-image, and content in stylesheets and scripts.

2) Using OptiPNG and JPEGTran binaries from NPM, built-in image optimization is available in production mode.

3) Utilizes the appropriate CSS compilers to support Sass, LESS, and Stylus.

4) UglifyJS is used to mutilate and minify JavaScript assets.

5) Automatic asset change detection; only updated assets will be uploaded to S3 in production mode.

6) Makes use of express-cachebuster and h5bp-inspired cachebusting.

7) The Content-Encoding header is set to gzip and all assets are compressed using zlib into a gzip buffer for S3 uploading.

8) Use several assets in a single embed 

9) Processes and loads assets for each view (allowing you to minimise client HTTP requests).

10) Use an easy array argument to group together frequently used resources.



Working of Express-CDN:

Depending on the server settings, the module returns a view helper when the server first starts up (production or development). Additionally, it recursively looks
through your viewsDir for any views that contain CDN instances. It will utilise your S3 login information to upload a fresh copy of the production-quality assets after
parsing each instance and eliminating duplicates.
