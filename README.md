# SQE-Phase-3
Explored different Open Source Projects (such as VLC, Linux, WordPress and Chromium).
In our first meeting we selected Linux as an open source and started working on it.
But later on after exploring Linux and consulting with our course Sir, we rejected it as it was a huge platform to explore and we are not very much professional and still in our learning phase.
In our second meeting after some research and exploring multiple projects more, we selected Vue-Storefront and WordPress as our Open Source Projects.
Another meeting was held and it was decided to choose 2 more projects and after researching again some open source projects we optded Node.js and React.
